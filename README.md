# Serper's Magic Ratio
Demonstrates the calculation of the area-ratio between a triangle's circumscribed inner and outer circles, based on only 2 angles as input.

The code as demonstrated in ratio.html, ration.js and ratio.css shows the method of calculating the ratio between the two respective circles, as depicted in ratio_form.jpg
The formula as used is also shown in ratio_form.jpg

I have derived this formula by myself at the age of 19 (not 100% sure, but around that age), out of curiousity and my interest in mathematics during my early science education. It was around 2009 (more than 15 years later), when I created my own website and put the formula into programming code to demonstrate my find. Since my website is not active anymore, I decided to immortilize it in GitHub. Who knows for what purpose it can be used?

I was inspired to derive this formula after reading Archimedes's obsessions with circles and put the challenge to myself to explore my own limits of understanding and abilities. Note that the ratio is not depending on any absolute values of circle or triangle size, the formula only needs two triangle angles to calculate the ratio between the two circles.
